# Osci-viewport

This is based on [osci-render-juce](https://github.com/jameshball/osci-render-juce), which is a full-featured oscilloscope music synthesizer. This plugin only includes the oscilloscope part.

## Current status

Osci-viewport is currently in development, but Version 1 is out now for people to use! There is one potential crash that I'm working on rooting out, as I have only had it happen once.

Current project status: Hunting for a crash
